# Data Normalization + Collection Page

```
collections => collections.find(collection => collection.id === COLLECTION_ID_MAP[collectionUrlParam]
```
// instead of doing the above, simply do the following after converting the data to object:

```
 collections => collections[collectionUrlParam]
``` // no need the COLLECTION_ID_MAP as well

# Data Flow In Our App
- Now that the selector inside our *CollectionsOverview* won't work anymore because
  the collections we receive is no longer an array. What can be done is writing another
  selector to convert the object back to array.
