Library: Styled Components. 

```
import styled from 'style-components';

// this is a component
const Text = styled.div`
  // CSS here
  color: #000;
`
```

- Generate unique classNames for elements. 
- Reusable (sharing constants). 
- All selectors are supported. 

```
const Text = styled.div`
  // CSS here
  color: #000;
  border: ${({isActive})} => isActive ? '1px solid black' : '3px dotted green';
`
<Text isActive={true}>I am a component</Text>
```
