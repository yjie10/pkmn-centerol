# Moving Our Shop Data To Firebase
- we will be making a new util to add our shop data object to Firebase. 
  ```
  // gotta call this function somewhere in our App where we have access to the shop data
  export const addCollectionAndDocuments = (collectionKey, objectsToAdd) => {
    const collectionRef = firebase.collection(collectionKey);
    console.log(collectionRef);
  }

  // we want to fire this function one time only; which we will do in our App - componentDidMount()
  // we then will remove the code after it's done
  ```
  
- adding the data to backend
  ```
  // bringing in selector from redux to App, and the addCollectionAndDocuemnts we just wrote
  import { auth, createUserProfileDocument, addCollectionAndDocuments } from './firebase/firebase.utils';
  import { selectShopCollectionsForPreview } from './redux/shop/shop.selectors';
  ```
