// notes for self-use 02.11.22

- when the data was moved to Firebase, we removed the route name;
  the reason is because the route name is not important to the backend / only relavent to the frontend. 

- we want to write the data fetching code that will only fetch the data one time, 
  and put it in the nearest ancestor that needs the data. 

- we would fetch the data in *ShopPage* component if follow the above.

- we would first convert the functional component into a class component. 

```
// original
const ShopPage = ({ match }) => (
  <div className='shop-page'>
    <Route exact path={`${match.path}`} component={CollectionsOverview} />
    <Route path={`${match.path}/:collectionId`} component={CollectionPage} />
  </div>
);

export default ShopPage;
```
