// notes for self-use 02.12.22

- now we have the reducer set up, we don't need the shop data on our frontend anymore. 

```
import SHOP_DATA from './shop.data'; // can remove this

import { ShopActionTypes } from './shop.types';

const INITIAL_STATE = {
  collections: SHOP_DATA
} // can remove this

const shopReducer = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {

    case ShopActionTypes.UPDATE_COLLECTIONS:
      return {
        ...state,
        payload: action.payload
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default shopReducer;
```

- we'll set the initial state of collections to null, which involves couple new issues; 

- selector will result in error because collections is expecting an object; 

```
// so we check if collections exist, if not, it will return an empty array
export const selectShopCollectionsForPreview = createSelector(
  [selectShopCollections],
  collections => collections ? Object.keys(collections).map(key => collections[key]) : 
  []
);
```

- what we do if there's a null value for our collections object?
- data fetching is asynchronous so we need to create a loading state. 
- we will build a spinner component - it will be a higher-order-component. 
- we put the logic in the *ShopPage* because this is where we'll know that we've
  finished fetching data from the backend.
