# Adding a Project to Firebase

Notes:

- To create a Firebase project:
  1. https://console.firebase.google.com
  2. Create project, enter project name and continue;
  3. Project Overview - </> Web; register App, no need hosting.
  4. following code generated: 

  ```
    // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
    // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    // For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyC0b0F31tS_p2ZBx16ROUSCPBF3CwCCjtc",
      authDomain: "pkmn-centerol.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "pkmn-centerol",
      storageBucket: "pkmn-centerol.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "371854459025",
      appId: "1:371854459025:web:a1b2e68052a1cb2c323f30",
      measurementId: "G-CH48GBYGY6"
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

  ```

    - we only need firebaseConfig


# Google Sign In Authentication

Notes:

Part 1 - Setting Up: 
- Add new folder *firebase* under src. 

- no need +firestore+ yet, but export it for later use. 

- go to Firebase-Authentication, and enable Google. 

Part 2 - Application listening to Authentication state changes:
- firebase Authentication, under Users we can see who signed in; 
  how do we add this authentication into our application?

- we want to store the state of our users (sign in using Google or email/pw) in our 
  App.js state, so we could pass into components that needs it. 

- therefore, we need to convert our App into a class component and store currentUser in state. 

- we would also want the App to notice when there's a change to the Authentication, 
  if the user signed in or signed out, firebase auth provides the functionality so we don't have
  to manuallly fetch. 

- auth.onAuthStateChanged() - this is an open subscription, we also need to close subscription
  when it unmounts to avoid memory leaks. 

Part 3 - Sign Out of Auth:
- when the user is signed in, the original +sign in+ should say +sign out+. 

- to implement, need to make sure our *Header* is aware. 

- import +auth+ into *Header* which provides +Sign Out+ for us. 

- +currentUser+ passed in from App will let us know if an user is signed in;
  we use ternary operator which we will render a div for +Sign Out+ if the user is signed in;
  and render a +Link+ if the user is not signed in. 

- we will also modify the *CustomButton* and apply styling for the Sign in with Google. 
  > this will be different from the course final product. 

CSS related: 

- I want a --OR-- separating +Sign In+ button and +Sign In With Google+ button. 
- the CSS is to wrap the <span>OR</span> with a div, setting the line height to 0 and a border-bottom, 
  and set a padding for the <span>OR</span> and set the background color to white (or matching color w/ app)
  which creates a effct of <hr> but with the text in center and not strikethrough. 

# Firebase Firestore

Notes: 
- go to Firestore Database and select Create database. 
- Firebase is a NoSQL database; there are 2 types of data:
  > 1. collection (like an array)
  > 2. document

# Storing User Data In Firebase

Notes: 
- we going to take the user information and create a user profile, which the function will be async,
  because we are making an API call. 

- the function should check if we are getting back a valid object, that is, when a user is signed in, 
  not when they sign out. 

- the +firestore+ library gives back one of two different types of potential objects;
  either:
  > 1. QueryReference
    -- an object that represents the "current" place in the db that we are querying
  > 2. QuerySnapshot 

- from +snapShot+ we check if the user data already exists, if not, we create. 


Code #1: 
// prev code
```
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribeFromAuth = auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => this.setState({ currentUser: user }));
  }
```
