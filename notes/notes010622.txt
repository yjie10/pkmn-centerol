# Adding a Project to Firebase

Notes:

- To create a Firebase project:
  1. https://console.firebase.google.com
  2. Create project, enter project name and continue;
  3. Project Overview - </> Web; register App, no need hosting.
  4. following code generated: 

  ```
    // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
    // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    // For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyC0b0F31tS_p2ZBx16ROUSCPBF3CwCCjtc",
      authDomain: "pkmn-centerol.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "pkmn-centerol",
      storageBucket: "pkmn-centerol.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "371854459025",
      appId: "1:371854459025:web:a1b2e68052a1cb2c323f30",
      measurementId: "G-CH48GBYGY6"
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

  ```

    - we only need firebaseConfig


# Google Sign In Authentication

Notes:

Part 1: 
- Add new folder *firebase* under src. 

- no need +firestore+ yet, but export it for later use. 

- go to Firebase-Authentication, and enable Google. 

Part 2:
- firebase Authentication, under Users we can see who signed in; 
  how do we add this authentication into our application?

- we want to store the state of our users (sign in using Google or email/pw) in our 
  App.js state, so we could pass into components that needs it. 

- therefore, we need to convert our App into a class component and store currentUser in state. 

- we would also want the App to notice when there's a change to the Authentication, 
  if the user signed in or signed out, firebase auth provides the functionality so we don't have
  to manuallly fetch. 

- auth.onAuthStateChanged() - this is an open subscription, we also need to close subscription
  when it unmounts to avoid memory leaks.
