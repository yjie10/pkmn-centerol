Summary: 
- setting up redux; configuring. 
- wrap entire application with <Provider> so whole app has access to redux. (?)
- redux folder under src, and inside redux we have root-reducer and store. 
- each slice of different reducer will be in its own folder & reducer (e.g. user reducer).
- in the slice of the reducer, e.g. user, we have this reducer _function_ that takes in 
  a state (initial / current state) and an action. 
- use switch case (can also use if-else) and if an action match the state will be updated. 
- action will be in its own file;
  the action has two parts: 1) type 2) payload; type is a string, and payload can be anything;
  in this case, the type is SET_CURRENT_USER and the payload is user. 
- import in the slice of the reducer into root-reducer, which is to be passed into store to have redux work. 

# Setting Up Redux
- Action -- Middleware --> Root Reducer -> Store -> DOM changes

- +middleware+ is a piece of code that gets the action before the root reducuer. 

Code #1:
// index.js

// the new component we get from react-redux that will give our 
// application access to the store and reducers
```
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
```

- *Provider* should be wrapped around the entire application. 

- just like what was done for firebase, a new folder called redux 
  will be created under src. 

- we will first write the +root-reducer+. It is the base object that
  represents all of the state of the application. 

- will be writing reducer for +user+. Anything related to user will go under here;
  right now, currentUser state lives in App.js. 

- reducer gets the +initial state+ and +action+; action consists of type and a payload. 

- the state is something redux +store+ going to pass to the reducer 
  whenever an action fires; the state is whatever the state is currently
  when the action gets fired. 

- when the state is fired for the first time, it's going to be nothing bc redux doesn't know;
  and therefore we need to set an initial state, just like what we usually do in 
  this.state = {};

Code #2:
```
const INITIAL_STATE = { currentUser: null }; 
// default param, if state is ever undefined it will be set to INITIAL_STATE
const userReducer = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) =>
```

- every single reducer gets every single action that ever gets fired,
  even if the action are not related to the reducer; 
  that's why we default return the state;

- export userReducer and bring it into the root-reducer. 

- in order to combine all the reducers, need to import in a function 
  called +combineReducers+ from redux library inside root-reducer.

- next step is to bring it into the store;
  create new store.js under redux. 

- +createStore+ needs to be imported as well as +applyMiddleware+;
  middleware is for whenever action gets fired or dispatched, we can 
  catch and display them; logger is useful for debugging redux code.

- the middleware the store is expecting is in the form of an array. 

Code #3:
```
const middlewares = [logger];
```

- to actually create the store, we use +createStore+ which gets a 
  root reducer and the return value from applyMiddleware which we spread in middlewares.

Code #4:
// the spread operator will spread in all the values in the array into
// the function applyMiddleware as individual arguments. 
```
  const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(...middlewares));
``` 

- the above was done so the code is more scalable, because if there were
  new middleware, we would only have to make changes to the const middlewares;

Code #5:
// we could've done this
```
  const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(logger));
```

- after store is exported out, we bring it into index.js into *Provider*. 


<hr />


# connect() and mapStateToProps
- we know conceptually we need to bring user reducers -- currentUser value into where we needed, 
  which will be our *Header* component, because currently *Header* is getting the currentUser from App.js. 

- what we want is the *Header* component to pull the user off the user reducer. 

- first thing to do is to import in +connect+ function from react redux; 
  +connect+ is a higher order component, which lets us to modify our component
  to have access to things related to redux. 

Code #1: 
```
  import { connect } from 'react-redux';
```

- going to pass 2 functions, the second one being optional; 

- the first argument: function that allows us to access the state;
  the state being root reducer. 

Code #2:
// equal to a function, returning an object, where the name of the property
// will be the property we want to pass in, and value will be the value;

// we get the state object (the root reducer / top level root reducer) and
// we want to pass in a currentUser property, where the value will be state.user.currentUser;
```
// the naming can be anything but mapStateToProps is standard with redux codebases
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  currentUser: state.user.currentUser
})

// state (root reducer) -> user -> user reducer -> currentUser
```

Code #3:
// this will return us another HOC that we pass in *Header*;
```
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Header);
```

- now we can remove the passing of currentUser from App state. 

Code #4:
```
  <Header currentUser={this.state.currentUser} /> // No longer

  ->

  <Header />

```


<hr />


# mapDispatchToProps

- now that *Header* is modified, to be receiving +currentUser+ value
  from reducer, App.js needs to be updated as well so that it's able to
  update the reducer value with the new _setCurrentUser_ action. 

- +connect+ will be needed within App.js as well. 

- as mentioned previously, connect() can take in 2 arguments;
  the first is mapStateToProps, the second is mapDispatchToProps;
  mapDispatchToProps will be used in App.js.

- since no state is needed, first argument (mapStateToProps) can be null;

Code #1:
// gets +dispatch+ property and will return an object where the 
// name of the property we want to pass in dispatches the new action we trying to pass; 
// setCurrentUser in this case; (import into App.js)
```
const mapDispatchToProps = ({
  // goes to a function that gets the user obejct and then calls dispatch -- a way for redux
  // to know the object passed in goes to every reducer -- ????

  // just dispatching the object
  setCurrentUser: user => dispatch(setCurrentUser(user)); // user here will be used as payload
});
```

- after passing in the second argument, we no longer need constructor with this.state;

- setState code will be replaced with setCurrentUser action code. 


<hr />


# User Redirect and User Action Type
- we want to redirect user once they are signed in and they should not have 
  access to the sign in page anymore.

- need 2 things: 1) *Redirect* component from react router and 2) need currentUser from Redux state;

Code #1:
```
  <Route path='/signin' component={SignInSignUpPage} /> // current code

  ->

  // instead of component, we are going to use render; 
  // by using render, it will return some JS code
```

- check if user is signed in, if so we will redirect the user to the home page,
  if not we render <SignInSignUpPage/>;

- another modification to be made is to the actions; right now 
  the action and in the reducer are all hard coded. To avoid typos, 
  a new file user.types is created to store the userActionTypes which 
  is then imported into reducer and action;
