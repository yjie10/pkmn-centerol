# Cart Component
- svg for cart icon. 

- need a *CartIcon* component that represents both the icon and the number (in the shopping cart).

- afterwards, import it into *Header*. 


<hr />


# Cart Dropdown Component
- there's a container, items that are scrollable, and a checkout button. 

- we need a *Cart* component.

- (Styling) margin-top auto will ensure the button is always at the bottom. 

Code #1: 
```
  button {
    margin-top: auto;
  }
```

- *CartDropdown* should sit out of the options div. 

- (Styling) z-index to ensure the *CartDropdown* is on the top layer and not hiding under other components.

Code #2: 
```
  z-index: 5;
```

- going to set a reducer to conditionally show or hide the cart, 
  based on clicking of the icon.
