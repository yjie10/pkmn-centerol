Building: 
- Each item has a hover effect 'ADD TO CART' when hovered on the item. 

- Once 'ADD TO CART' is clicked, it will add the item to the cart, 
  > New item to the cart with quantity 1, 
  > Existing item increasing the count

- New and existing item will be shown in both the *CartDropdown*
  and the CheckOut Page (not yet build). 

- First set up *CollectionItem* to have the hover effect, and then
  the redux to store cart items.

# Add To Cart Styling
- similar to google sign in, go to *CustomButton* and add the property inverted to
  invert the colors for when hovered on item. 

- add inverted to *CustomButton* and applied the styling. 

- making custom changes to custom button in the *CollectionItem* styling sheet (hover effect, display).
