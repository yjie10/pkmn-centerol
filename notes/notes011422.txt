- cart action: Add Item to Cart and bring it in to *CollectionItem*

# Adding Multiple Items To Cart
Overview: 
·· tl;dr: Group Items with quantity property
· right now when action ADD_ITEM is performed, the cart allows duplicate items to be added;
· we want to increase the quantity of the item when existing item is being added again,
  and only add new item if it doesn't already exist;
---

- create an utility function under cart -> cart.utils.js

- utility functions allow us to keep our files clean and organzie functions
  that we may need in multiple files in one location. 

- write the 'addItem' with two arguments, 
  first: existing cart items, 
  second: cart item we want to add

- we will check the existing cartItem to see if the 
  +cartItemToAdd+ already exists

Code #1:
/* note: lecture video have the function name as 
  addItemToCart, but I want to keep the function names consistent
  and therefore will use the same 'addItem' as the action name;
*/
```
export const addItem = (cartItems, cartItemToAdd) => ...
```

- after creating the function, we import it to our +cart reducer+

Code #2:
```
// replace cartItems: [...state.cartItems, action.payload]
  case CartActionTypes.ADD_ITEM:
    return {
      ...state,
      cartItems: [...state.cartItems, action.payload]
    }

// with 
  return {
    ...state,
    cartItems: addItem(...state.cartItems, action.payload)
  }

```

- one more modification: some items in shop data have the same id, 
  need to update them so each item have a unique id (important)

# Cart Item Component
Overview:
· create cart-item component
---

- after creating the functional *CartItem*, we need to import it into *CartDropdown*

- as we need access to the +item+ properties, we will pull it off from redux state

// minor changes to displaying the name in *CartItem*
```
  <span className='name'>{name.length < 25 ? name : `${name.slice(0, 25)}...`}</span>
```
