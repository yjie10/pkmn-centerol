01.14.22 Summary: 
- grouping items in cart (giving it a quantity property) using cart util function. 
- created *CartItem* component.

# Selectors In Redux
Overview:
· we want to display number of items in the cart
· update the counter in our *CartIcon* (shopping cart)
---

- using what we know of redux, something we can do is write a 
  +mapStateToProps+ inside *CartIcon* where we would pull the state in, and then get the 
  value (↓ code below ↓)

```
// CartIcon 
const mapStateToProps = ({ cart: cartItems }) => ({
  itemCount: cartItems.reduce((accumalatedQuantity, cartItem) => accumalatedQuantity + cartItem.quantity, 0) // 0 is the initial value
  // const reducer = (previousValue, currentValue) => previousValue + currentValue; 
})
```
// reduce: executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array... 
// the final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value (MDN Web Docs)

- the above code is called +Selector+, because we are passing in the whole state
  but only using a small portion of the state -- we are computing a new value based off the state

>>> 有Correction: ' Due to ItemCount bring a primitive (integer), redux will do a shallow equality
                    check under the hood between state changes in mapStateToProps. 
                    If our overall state changes but the itemCount value stays the same between 
                    these changes, redux's shallow equality check will see that itemCount is the same 
                    value as last time and save us a re-render. '

                    但是计算还是会计算的（只不过不re-render component），所以写selctor还是属于good practice. 

- the caveat (warning / limitations) though, is that whenever _any_ +reducer+ updates,
  we always return a new object, and when this happens, Redux re-composes and re-builds the 
  _entire_ state object, +mapStateToProps+ is getting called every single time -- component always gets re-rendered

- 接上，也就是说当不是cart的reducer being called时 (e.g. user reducer being called)，
  the +mapStateToProps+ inside *CartIcon* is also called; 

- and this is important because the .reduce() function written for accumalating itemCount
  is returning a new value (re-computing) every time +mapStateToProps+ is called, even if the value doesn't update
  (and this is because every time the state updates, it's a _BRAND NEW_ object, even if the value are the same)

- 综上所述，会影响到performance

- so what we want to do is to store/cache the value of what our +selector+ is using;
  if our value didn't change, we don't want to re-render our component -- this is called _MEMOIZATION_

- we can achieve this kind of +memoization+ using a library called +Reselect+

# Reselect Library
Overview:
· bringing in +reselect+ library
· use the library to write memoized selectors
---

- change up folder structure: create a new file called +cart.selectors.js+ under 
  the cart redux folder (in case we want to use the selector code somewhere else)

- notes on selectors:
  > there are two types of selectors we can write,
    1. input selector: that doesn't use +createSelctor+,
    2. out selector: that DOES use +createSelctor+ _and_ +input selector+

- +Input Selector+:
  > a function that gets the whole state and just returns a slice of it (one layer deep usually)
  (↓ Code ↓)

  ```
  const selectCart = state => state.cart;
  ```

- +Output Selector+: 
  > takes in two arguments, 
    1. a collection (array) of input selector, 
    2. a function that return the value we want out of the selctor
    (↓ Code ↓)

  // 'CartItems' is a property (state) on our cart
  ```
    export const selectCartItems = createSelctor(
      [selectCart],
      (cart) => cart.cartItems
    )
  ``` // createSelctor -> memoized selector

- we can also use the selector code in other components that uses +cartItems+,
  e.g. *CartDropdown* (↓ Code ↓)


  ```
  const mapStateToProps = ({ cart: { cartItems } }) => ({
    cartItems: cartItems
    })

  →

  // bringing in +selectCartItems+ selector
  const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    cartItems: selectCartItems(state)
  })
  ```

# User Selectors
Overview:
· now that we wrote cart selectors, update user as well
---

- 自己先写：create new file under redux-user folder
  (↓ Code ↓)

```
// input selector
const selectUser = state => state.user;

export const selectCurrentUser = createSelector(
  [selectUser],
  (user) => user.currentUser
); 
```

- bringing in the selector into: *Header* and *App*

- also make a selector for +hidden+

  ```
  const mapStateToProps = ({ user: { currentUser }, cart: { hidden } }) => 
  ({
    currentUser,
    hidden
  })

  →

  const mapStateToProps = (state) => (
  {
    currentUser: selectCurrentUser(state),
    hidden: selectCartHidden(state)
  })
  ```

- also bringing in +createStuctureSelector+, so above code becomes: 
  (↓ Code ↓)

  ```
  const mapStateToProps = createStructuredSelector({
    currentUser: selectCurrentUser,
    hidden: selectCartHidden
    })
  ```

- same thing will be done in *App.js* and other components as well in case in the future
  we are bringing in more selectors
