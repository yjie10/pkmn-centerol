01.21.22 Summary: 
- Created *CheckoutItem* component. 
- Added 'remove item', 'reduce item' functionality in Redux (redux action / utils). 
- Imported the action to *CheckoutItem* component: 
  > increase item quantity: ADD_ITEM
  > decrease item quantity: REDUCE_ITEM
  > remove item from cart: REMOVE_ITEM

# Local Storage and Session Storage
Overview:
· Problem: if the user refreshes the page, everything in store will be gone -- reducers gets reset. 
· User is not being reset because the state is not stored by the application, it's handled by firebase auth,
  which comes with session persistence. 

---

- Redux Persist allow us to store session using local storage
- Notes on local storage:
  > window.localStorage vs window.sessionStorage
    · session storage is within the session, which if the tab remains open,
      it will be stored; if the tab is closed, the we lose the data
    · localStorage will persist until we clear it out
  > localStorage has a getItem and setItem - stores string only

  ```
  const objToStore = { description: 'some object' }
  // first param: key
  window.localStorage.setItem('myObj', JSON.stringfy(objToStore)) // to store; converting the obj to string
  window.localStorage.getItem('myObj') // to access, will return a string
  
  const objToRetrive = window.localStorage.getItem('myObj);
  JSON.parse(objToRetrive) // to convert back to Object
  ```

# Redux Persist
Overview:
· Bringing in redux persist into the Application. 

- the redux persist library leverages both local and session storage
- have some config need to do: 
  > 1. go to store.js, bring in { persistStore } from 'redux-persist';
       it allows the browser to actually cache our store (depending on our config)
  > 2. const persistor = persistStore(store); // essentially a persisted version of our store;
       instead of export default only store, change it to export default { store, persistor }
  > 3. update root reducer, import { persistReducer } from 'redux-persist';
       and also import in the type of storage (local / session) we want;
       import storage from 'redux-persist/lib/storage'; // default using local storage
       alternatively sessionStorage
  > 4. define config _object_;
       no need to persist user reducer because it is being handled by firebase auth
  ```
  const persistConfig = {
  key: 'root', // where in our reducer do we want to start storing everything
  storage, // pass storage, which is storage (which was imported in earlier)
  whitelist: ['cart'] // an array containing the reducers we want to store
  ```

  > 5. assign a name to the combineReducer (before was just export default)
  ```
  const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  cart: cartReducer
});
  ```

  > 6. exporting out: export default persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);
       exporting out the modified version of the rootReducer with the persistConfig on top of it
  > 7. go to index.js, bring in persistor
