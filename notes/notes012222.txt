# Local Storage and Session Storage
Overview:
· Problem: if the user refreshes the page, everything in store will be gone -- reducers gets reset. 
· User is not being reset because the state is not stored by the application, it's handled by firebase auth,
  which comes with session persistence. 

---

- Redux Persist allow us to store session using local storage
- Notes on local storage:
  > window.localStorage vs window.sessionStorage
    · session storage is within the session, which if the tab remains open,
      it will be stored; if the tab is closed, the we lose the data
    · localStorage will persist until we clear it out
  > localStorage has a getItem and setItem - stores string only

  ```
  const objToStore = { description: 'some object' }
  // first param: key
  window.localStorage.setItem('myObj', JSON.stringfy(objToStore)) // to store; converting the obj to string
  window.localStorage.getItem('myObj') // to access, will return a string
  
  const objToRetrive = window.localStorage.getItem('myObj);
  JSON.parse(objToRetrive) // to convert back to Object
  ```
