// notes for self-use


Project Design:
- final product home page: 6 categories: Plush, Figures & Pins, Game, Apparel, Accessories, Stationaries
- same component for each category, which has a outside and inside container; the inside container contains the title and sub-title
- have a directory component to display the category items on the home page

Building:
- first component built is the homepage.component.jsx
- directory-menu, menu-item etc. will be moved into their own component later on
- functional component because we don't really need any _lifecycle methods_ at this time nor do we need to store any _state_

Code#1:
const HomePage = () => (
  <div className="homepage">
    <div className="directory-menu">
      <div className="menu-item">
        <div className="content">
          <h1 className="title">PLUSH</h1>
          <span className="subtitle">SHOP NOW</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
) -> x6 for each other category

Styling: 
- will be using SASS
  ~ my dumbass wrapped every menu item in its own directory-menu and everything became block and I couldn't figure out why for so long ...
