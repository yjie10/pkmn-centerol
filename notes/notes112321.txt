// notes for self-use 11.23.21
// 1. directory branch - created directory and menu-item component

Project Design:
- created two folders: one for reusable components, one for page components
- page components are most likely going to be used once only
- therefore two components should be in separated folder

Building:
- _directory_ and _menu-items_ should be moved into their own components
- menu-items will be a functional component, no state needed as of now
- we do want the title to be dynamic, which should be passed in as props; destructuring is used here
- directory component will need to be a class component, because we need to store the state value of the menu-items
- we want to map through our categories, and pass the category object into the menu-item

Code#1: 
// instead of doing the following, which we have to type category every time
{
  this.state.categories.map(category => <MenuItem key={category.id} title={category.title} />)
}

// we can destructure the values off category
{
   this.state.categories.map({title, imageUrl, id} => <MenuItem key={id} imageUrl={imageUrl} title={title} />) 
}

Code#2:
// using the style attribute which allows us to dynamically make styles on our components
  <div style={{
    backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})`
  }} className="menu-item">
    <div className="content">
      <h1 className="title">{title}</h1>
      <span className="subtitle">SHOP NOW</span>
    </div>
  </div>

Code#3:
// does not apply to my proj atm but good to know

// adding something to the className if the value is present
  <div ...
    className={`${size} menu-item`}>
  </div>
