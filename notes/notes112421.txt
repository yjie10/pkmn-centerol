/* 
  1. Styling menu-item (cont. )
  2. Adding React Router
*/

Styling: 
- hover effect should go on the menu-item (for background-image & content)
- using scaling (transform) and cubic-bezier (transition) for transforming: allows a smoother transition, link included below
- because of scaling, the background-image will be growing outside of container, this is an _overflow_
- to avoid the overflow problem, we add overflow: hidden to menu-item

Building:
- using react-router-dom5.0.0
- first go to index.js and import BrowserRouter, which is a component we wrap around our app, it gives our application all function of what routing library provides

Code#1:

// quick component to see how react-router works

const PlushPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>PLUSH PAGE</h1>
  </div>
)

// without the exact keyword, if we enter '/plush', home page will be rendered as well because '/' matches
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route exact path='/' component={HomePage} />
      <Route path='/plush' component={PlushPage} />
    </div>
  );
}

- the other component we use is the Switch component
- to use it, we wrap our route components within it
- with just Route, it will render anything that matches path if without exact keyword
- but with Switch, the moment a Route inside Switch finds a match in the path, it will render only one route
- renders the first Route it finds a match
- Switch gives us more control over our code, useful as it avoids mutiple components to be (accidentally) rendered on the same page

Notes:
1. Routing in a single page application

- react is an UI library which doesn't come with routing (unlike Angular which is a framework), we need to add it ourselves
- Route is a component that takes a few arguments
- we focus on: exact, path and component
- _component_ will be the component we want the router to render
- _path_ will be a string that's equal to the path itself from the current place in our app
- _exact_ is a boolean, as name suggested, if path has to be exactly equal in order for a component to be rendered
- there are two ways to navigate using React router: 1) Link 2) history prop


Example#1: 
// App and 3 functional component (pages)

// any components that gets rendered by Route has three properties

/* if we console.log the props, it would be:
    1. history: see example#2
    2. location: tells us where we are currently, we focus on pathname for now; 
      I. pathname: gives us the full pathname we entered
    3. match:
      I. url - the url of the component it got rendered from the route; without the exact keyword, and if we were to render home ('/') and some other component (e.g. /topic), the url would return '/' only
      II. path - the path we entered that got rendered
      III. isExact - only true if the entire url is matching the pattern
      IV: parameter - object of url parameters; :topicId is a url parameter, it will match up to '/topics/' and anything afterward can be a dynamically changing value; we want to access the topicId value as a parameter
        Â· this is important because if we want to display the topicId, we do have access to this topic value
*/

const HomePage = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>HOME PAGE</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const TopicsList = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>TOPIC LIST PAGE</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const TopicDetail = (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>TOPIC DETAIL PAGE: { props.match.params.topicId }</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route exact path='/' componenet={HomePage} />
      <Route exact path='/topics' componenet={TopicsList} />
      <Route path='/topics/:topicId' componenet={TopicDetail} />
    </div>
  );
};

Example#2: 
/*
  history: in push, we push the string of the path we want to go
    - kind of like using a Link, but gives us more of a dynamic access
    - say if we want to navigate in componentDidMount(), we cannot render a link as it's just a method, but we can use history.push
*/

const HomePage = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => props.history.push('/topics')}>Topics</button>
      <h1>HOME PAGE</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
