// 1. Styling menu-item (cont. )

Styling: 
- hover effect should go on the menu-item (for background-image & content)
- using scaling (transform) and cubic-bezier (transition) for transforming: allows a smoother transition, link included below
- because of scaling, the background-image will be growing outside of container, this is an _overflow_
- to avoid the overflow problem, we add overflow: hidden to menu-item
