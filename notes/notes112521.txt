/* 
  1. Finishing up basic React Router
*/

Building:
- use a component called WithRouter, which is a higher order component
- a higher order component is essentially a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a modified component
- just like how menu-item takes argument such as title and imageUrl and renders out in the component, withRouter takes in MenuItem and returns a powered up component that gives us access to the router features
↑ Code#1 ↑

- instead of setting all the props on MenuItem as we are mapping through, we can use ES6 feature: spread oprator to shorten the code
↑ Code#2 ↑

- because we don't know in MenuItem, where in Directory we will be, so we can take the _match_ as well
- added .replace(/\s/g, '') to title when using history.push so it removes white space (for figures & pins)
↑ Code#3 ↑

Code#1:
// pass MenuItem to withRouter, which withRouter will return us back a powered up MenuItem with access to the props we need access to

const MenuItem = ({ title, imageUrl, history }) => (
  <div className='menu-item'>
    <div className='background-image' style={{
      backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})`
    }} />

    <div className='content'>
      <h1 className='title'>{title}</h1>
      <span className='subtitle'>SHOP NOW</span>
    </div>
  </div>
)

// with following code, we will have access to history
export default withRouter(MenuItem);

Code#2:
// a little ES6 trick we can use here, spread operator

// Original code
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='directory-menu'>
        {
          this.state.categories.map(({ id, title, imageUrl }) => <MenuItem key={id} title={title} imageUrl={imageUrl} />)
        }
      </div>
    )
  }

// w/ spread operator; equivalent to above
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='directory-menu'>
        {
          this.state.categories.map(({ id, ...otherCategoryProps }) => <MenuItem key={id} {...otherCategoryProps} />)
        }
      </div>
    )
  }

Code#3:
// /somematchedURL/linkURL

const MenuItem = ({ title, imageUrl, history, match }) => (
  <div className='menu-item' onClick={() => history.push(`${match.url}${title.replace(/\s/g, '')}`)}>
    <div className='background-image' style={{
      backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})`
    }} />

    <div className='content'>
      <h1 className='title'>{title}</h1>
      <span className='subtitle'>SHOP NOW</span>
    </div>
  </div>
)

Notes: 

1. React Router
- currently, only homepage has access to the _history_ prop (props.history), because that's the component we passed to the Route
- although Directory and MenuItem are children of HomePage, only our HomePage component will get access to the history prop
- so how do we set up our menu-item so it can navigate to different pages?  
- one way is to pass the history prop into our Directory, and from Directory pass into MenuItem
- the problem of this approach though, is that it's a bad pattern called prop drilling; children in between don't need the property other than to pass it to their children
- react router provides a solution for us to avoid doing so
