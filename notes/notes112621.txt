/* 
  Building a Shop Page for final product
*/

Project Design:
- next we will be building the shop page showing collection of all category of items
- there will be 4 (?) items for preview in each category, and a link to the actual category
- we will setup a _Collection Preview_ on our shop page
- we will be building a component for shop page itself (like home page), and a component for collection preview, and a component for the collection item

Building:
- because we need to store the data related to the actual collection on our shop page, the shop page will be a class component
- shop data is moved into a separate file as it's getting too big



Qs:
- Lecture Shop Page has included props in constructor and super, but when I console log it it doesn't seem to contain anything at the moment
