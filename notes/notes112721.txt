/* 
  Building a Shop Page for final product (cont.)
*/

Build:
- (cont.) loop thorugh collections on the Shop Page component, we will destructure the id and then use spread operator just like what we did for Directory
- now we filter the items to be displayed (preview) to limit to 4 (for now); for filter: display items index < 4 (0, 1, 2, 3)


- we are chaining the array methods here (filter & map)
- things to keep in mind here is that whenever the collection-preview component gets rendered, the array methods gets called everytime as well, which can cause a performance problem if the array gets too large or on a slower computer
- also it kind of bothers me the fact in the filter method, we only using index and don't have to use the item...
- we'll look at how to handle this kind of problem in later lectures
- just keep in mind that these anonymous function calls do get called over and over again whenever the component render or rerenders

Code#1:

    <div className='preview'>
      {/* mapping through the preview */}
      {items
        .filter((item, index) => index < 4)
        .map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
