Design: 
- now that we have the collection preview, we are going to start bulding the collection items
- the collection item component consists of an image, item title, item price and the button that allows the user to add the item to the cart
- functionality will be added later

Build: 
- props will be passed in, but no state needed for collection item
- the props we are passing in are the items props, which consists id, name, imageUrl and price
- for image, do the same for what we did for menu-item, using style attribute
- and then we will have collection-footer, which consists of two span elements for the item name and item price
- need to spend some time on css later
- now we pass collection-item component into collection-preview component, we can spread the item props like what we did for directory and shop-page
- now we add some padding to App.css so it gives some space
