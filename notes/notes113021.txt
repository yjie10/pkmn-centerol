/* 
  Header Component  
*/

Design:
- Header for user to navigate between different pages easier
- we want the Header component to be present at all times
- will be using svg file for the logo, which we create an assets folder under source

Build:
- Header component will be a functional component
- consists of option links (logo (should direct to home), shop, contact and signin, shopping cart) 
- import in Link from react-router for navigation, and logo from assets
- the <Link> will be the logo's container which we will apply styles to
- other options (shop, contact, signin, shopping cart) will be in a separate container, which will also be Links
- we will import the Header into App.js, and place the Header out of the <Switch />, and <Header /> will be rendered regardless of which of the Routes/Components are displayed
- will modify the <Link> tags so there's no underline that comes with <a> tag, will do so in App.css
- we can select <Link> and apply the styles, but since we would most likely want to apply to all <a> tags, so we'll just target <a> and put it in App.css

Notes: 

- (Code#1) this is a special syntax in React for importing SVG

↓ Code#1 ↓

```

import { ReactComponent as Logo } from '../../assets/pkball.svg';

```
