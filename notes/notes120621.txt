# Introducing Forms in React

Notes: 
- sign in pages are common in apps; it is a combination of creating +Forms+ 
  and doing something called +User Authentication+, where we are able to register 
  a user and check if a user already exist and let them sign in. 

- things to consider: where should the state of *SignIn* Component live? 
  · the state should live in their (*SignIn* and *SignUp*) own states because they don't need
    to talk to each other. 

- we want to keep the state to the lowest possible level, keeping the concern in place to
  whatever component needs it so we are more efficient with our code.

# Sign In Component

Notes:
- we are creating a *SignInSignUpPage* component which contains:
  1. SignIn Component
  2. SignUp Component

- *SignInSignUpPage* will be a functional component because 
  state will be kept on *SignIn* and *SignUp* components respectively.

- imported the new page component into App.js & updated Header Component,
  now route to /signin will display the *SignInSignUpPage* respectively. 

- will be building the *SignIn* component first and set up +Firebase+ for +User Authentication+. 

- as mentioned above, *SignIn* will be a +class component+ to store user input (e.g. email, password, etc.). 

- <em>I will be making some changes to the styling. </em>

- we will be using the native +<form>+ element to create the form first, and later apply custom styling. 

- added a +onSubmit+ function that calls the method +handleSubmit+ 
  which for now simply prevents default behavior and clear input fields. 

- added a +onChange+ function to input fields that calls the method +handleChange+
  which will handle the update to input fields (email & password). 
  · we dynamically set the state; 
    name is the name we assigned to the element, 
    state is the value the user typed in. 
  ```
  const { value, name } = event.target;
  this.setState({ [name]: value });
  ```
