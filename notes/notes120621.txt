# Introducing Forms in React

Notes: 
- sign in pages are common in apps; it is a combination of creating +Forms+ 
  and doing something called +User Authentication+, where we are able to register 
  a user and check if a user already exist and let them sign in. 
- things to consider: where should the state of *SignIn* Component live? 
  Â· the state should live in their (*SignIn* and *Register*) own states because they don't need
    to talk to each other
- we want to keep the state to the lowest possible level, keeping the concern in place to
  whatever component needs it so we are more efficient with our code
